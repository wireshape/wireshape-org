title: The Problem
description: New standard for product data.
---

E-commerces need reliable and complete information on the products for sale and do not have a data provider capable of meeting this demand.

The consumer ends up buying without knowing the product, resulting in dissatisfaction and returns.

And why does this happen?

* Typically adopted product identification standard is limited
* Focused on barcode
* Information provided is restricted and incomplete (typically only product name and manufacturer)
* Centralized registration system governed by monopoly
* Registration and consultation services are bureaucratic and expensive
* Fake reviews of products.
