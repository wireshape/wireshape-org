## Wireshape is the open blockchain for global product data.
Wireshape is an open blockchain solution that provides a decentralized, secure, and transparent way for storing and sharing product data. This eliminates the need for a central authority to manage and verify the data, and allows all stakeholders to trust the information being shared. The distributed nature of blockchain also ensures that the data is tamper-proof and cannot be altered without the consensus of the network participants.

### Current market challenges
One of the biggest challenges in supply chain management today is the lack of standardization in product information distribution. This can lead to confusion and misunderstandings between manufacturers, distributors, sellers and consumers, generating a high rate of complaints and returns, especially in online purchases, where it is difficult for consumers to find the information they need to make informed purchasing decisions.

### Open blockchain
Wireshape open blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the way that product data is managed and shared globally. With the increasing trend towards ecommerce, it has become increasingly important for product information to be easily accessible and standardized. 

By implementing Wireshape blockchain-based product information standard, all stakeholders in the product lifecycle, from manufacturers to consumers, can access and share accurate, up-to-date information in real-time.

### Token Curated Product Registry (TCPR) 
In Wireshape blockchain the engine of decentralization of product data is in charge of the Token Curated Product Registry (TCPR), a decentralized system of curation of product information, which creates a reliable database recorded on the blockchain and maintained by the community, which receives intrinsic incentives in WWIRE tokens as rewards.

### API
Innovative platforms and e-commerces can quickly populate their systems with complete product data by integrating the API provided by Wireshape with blockchain data, making it easier and more cost-effective to launch.

This encourages decentralization and innovation in the consumer goods space which leads to a better and more equitable experience for all stakeholders.
