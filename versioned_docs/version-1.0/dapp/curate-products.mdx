A 24hr voting period is provided for each product registration application, so that the community can evaluate the accuracy of the submitted data and vote for or against the registry. You can better understand the curation system and workflow of the Token Curated Product Registry here: https://wireshape.org/docs/whitepaper/tcpr. So go to https://staging.wireshape.org/applications and check out the products that are up for voting. Before voting, make sure you have the product in hand to ensure data fidelity.
