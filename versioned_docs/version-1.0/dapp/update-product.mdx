description: How to suggest a product update, either fixing or adding product data.

If a product is already registered or applied for registration, you can check the registered data and if necessary, you can propose an update.

You can propose an Update Product to enter, change or update data about the product, such as a new packaging image, description, ingredient as well as any other relevant information.

Vote Period

Just like adding a product, a 24hr voting period is provided for each product update application, so that the community can evaluate the accuracy of the submitted data and vote for or against the registry. You can better understand the curation system and workflow of the Token Curated Product Registry here: https://wireshape.org/docs/whitepaper/tcpr

Update Product

This document provides instructions on how to submit structured product data updates for decentralized registry on the Wireshape blockchain. With it, you can enter all the necessary information about the products, such as brand, description, features, image, among other important information.

Requirements
To use the Wireshape dApp, you need a modern web browser such as Brave, Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge. Additionally, you need to have a stable internet connection and to connect your EVM compatible wallet, such as Metamask, Brave or Trust Wallet to interact with the platform.

The entire curation system is on-chain, which guarantees security and decentralization, so you will need WIRE tokens for the gas fee and WWIRE (Wrapped Wire) to carry out the Product Registry Application. All incentives, transactions and rewards are performed in WWIRE. You can free Swap WIRE / WWIRE here: https://staging.wireshape.org/swap
