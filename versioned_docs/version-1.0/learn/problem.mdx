title: The Problem
description: New standard for Product data.
---

Today we have a problem of fake reviews of products in e-commerces or marketplaces and even this is centralized and controlled by specific entities.

* E-commerces lack reliable and necessary product information.
* The consumer ends up buying without knowing the product, resulting in dissatisfaction and returns.
* Product Identification Standard is limited
* Focused on barcode
* Centralized info and governed by a monopoly
* Information provided is restricted and incomplete
* Registration and consultation services are bureaucratic and expensive
