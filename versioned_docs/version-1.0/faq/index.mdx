### How can I get involved as a contributor?
Wireshape has created open opportunities for contribution. Fill out the form and let us know how you would like to contribute and start getting involved: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjMtXpoBhIzrHqlCZQs7CapgMXDxYJI22iXvAfNX7h7rNaFw/viewform.

### How does Wireshape's governance work?
Looking for gradual decentralization, Wireshape is creating ways to listen to the community and give each DAO member voting power to decide the project's path. You can check the current active proposals on Snapshot: https://snapshot.org/#/wireshape-dao.eth.

### What is Wireshape Blockchain?

Wireshape is an open blockchain solution that provides a decentralized, secure, and transparent way for storing and sharing supply-chain data. This eliminates the need for a central authority to manage and verify the data, and allows all stakeholders to trust the information being shared. The distributed nature of blockchain also ensures that the data is tamper-proof and cannot be altered without the consensus of the network participants, which results in traceability and security.

### What is Wireshape dApp?

Wireshape dApp is where consumers, suppliers and vendors can interact with Wireshape's smart contracts. Through the Token Curated Product Registry (TCPR) system they can add data, curate and receive rewards for their contributions in creating a reliable products information database recorded on the blockchain and maintained by the community. Read more about TCPR features here: https://wireshape.org/docs/whitepaper/tcpr

### What are the requirements to start using Wireshape dApp?

To use the Wireshape dApp, you need a modern web browser such as Brave, Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari or Edge. Additionally, you need to have a stable internet connection and to connect your EVM compatible wallet, such as Metamask, Brave or Trust Wallet to the Floripa Testnet Network during the beta period to interact with the platform. The entire curation system is on-chain, so you will need WIRE tokens for the gas fee and WWIRE (Wrapped Wire) to carry out the Product Registry Application. You can free Swap WIRE / WWIRE here: https://staging.wireshape.org/swap

### How do I register a product?

First of all, make sure you have the product with GTIN barcode in hand to ensure data fidelity; a ruler or similar measuring tool; a scale - we recommend using a high precision scale (1 gram) for products up to 10kg. To get started you must comply with the above requirements and go to the product registration page: https://staging.wireshape.org/add-product, where you should enter all the necessary product information. Read the full documentation on how to add a product here: https://wireshape.org/docs/dapp/add-product

### How can I curate a product?

A 24hr voting period is provided for each product registration application, so that the community can evaluate the accuracy of the submitted data and vote for or against the registry. You can better understand the curation system and workflow of the Token Curated Product Registry here: https://wireshape.org/docs/whitepaper/tcpr. So go to https://staging.wireshape.org/applications and check out the products that are up for voting. Before voting, make sure you have the product in hand to ensure data fidelity.

### How am I rewarded for contributing product data?

All incentives, transactions and rewards are performed in WWIRE. You can free Swap WIRE / WWIRE here https://staging.wireshape.org/swap. 50M of WIRE tokens are reserved for incentives for the first 1M of registered products (validated applications and updates). Applicants, voters and brands are rewarded when a WWIRE prize pool is formed in their interactions. All distribution of rewards and incentives is self-governed by the TCPR system, read here how it works: https://wireshape.org/docs/whitepaper/tcpr

### How do I get a brand-verified product data badge?

If you are a supplier / manufacturer, you can request Verify Brand Domain. Only authorized representatives with access to an official brand email can be verified. Once your registration is validated, you can start to add or update the products of the brand you are a representative of. You can Verify Brand Domain here: https://staging.wireshape.org/verify-brand

### How does the Wireshape Beta Program work?

The participants in the Wireshape Private Beta Program have the unique opportunity to contribute to the creation of top-quality product data, and in turn be rewarded with WIRE tokens that can be used on the Wireshape mainnet. For every successful application, the participant will receive 30 mainnet WIRE tokens when it launches. Additionally, the participant will receive 3 mainnet WIRE tokens for every winning vote/curatorship in the application. The number of tokens rewarded will be based on the contribution score, which will be calculated based on the quality and precision of the contributions. Each participant accepted into the program will receive 31 WIRE tokens on the Wireshape Testnet. These tokens will enable the participant to start contributing to the platform right away.

### How do I use products data in my ecommerce?
